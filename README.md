<h1>Airport Simulator Project</h1>

  <p>The Airport Project is a web application that provides a server-client solution for managing airport operations.
    The project consists of an ASP.NET server and an Angular client-side application.</p>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

  <p>Before running the Airport Project, please ensure that you have the following software installed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>MongoDB: The project requires MongoDB to store and manage data. Install MongoDB by following the official installation
      guide for your operating system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Server Setup</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Open the ASP.NET server project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).</li>
    <li>Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine.</li>
    <li>Configure the connection string for MongoDB in the server's appsettings.json file, if necessary.</li>
    <li>Build and run the server project. This will start the ASP.NET server on the specified port (e.g.,
      <code>https://localhost:7209</code>).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Client Setup</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Open the client-side project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code).</li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
      <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>After the dependencies are installed, start the Angular development server by running the following command:
      <pre><code>ng serve</code></pre>
      This will start the client application on a development server (e.g., <code>http://localhost:4200</code>).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>Once the server and client are running, you can access the Airport Project through your web browser. Open your
    preferred browser and navigate to the client application's URL (e.g., <code>http://localhost:4200</code>).</p>

  <p>The Airport Project allows you to perform various airport management operations, such as running the simulator,
    adding flights, and monitoring airport resources. Explore the user interface and follow the provided features and
    functionality to interact with the application.</p>
